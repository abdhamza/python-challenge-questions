### 24) Movie List
Create a list of your `7 favorite movies` and print the third movie on the list.

### 25) Combining Lists
Combine two lists into a `single list` without using the `+` operator.

### 26) Color List Modification
Given a list of colors: `["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]`, write a Python script that inserts "orange" after "green" and removes "yellow". Print the final list of colors.

### 27) Pet Name Removal
Create a list of pet names. Write a script that asks the user for a pet name and removes that pet name from the list if it exists. If the pet name does not exist in the list, print an appropriate message.

### 28) Favorite Colors
Write a program that asks the user to enter three favorite colors, one by one. Store these colors in a list. Then, print the first and last color entered.

### 29) List Modification with User Input
Ask the user to create a list of four numbers by entering them one at a time. After the list is created, ask the user for a number to add to the list, but they must also specify the position (index) in the list where this new number should be placed, replacing the existing number at that position. Print the updated list.

### 30) Movie List Management
Create a program where the user enters five movie names to store in a list. After the list is created, ask the user for a movie name to remove from the list. Remove the movie by directly specifying its value (not by index, since you haven't learned loops for finding indexes). Print the updated list.

### 31) Expanding a Simple List
Write a program that starts with a list of two items: `["Hello", "World"]`. Ask the user to add three more words to the list, entering them one at a time. After adding each word, print the current state of the list.

### 32) Hobbies and Foods Nested List
Ask the user to enter their top three hobbies and then their top three foods. Store these in two separate lists. Then, create a nested list that contains both lists and print it. Finally, ask the user to select a number: `1` for hobbies or `2` for foods. Based on their choice, print the corresponding list from the nested list.

### 33) String Manipulation and Searching
Consider the string `text = "Python programming is fun`, isn't it?". Use string methods to replace all instances of `'is'` with `'should be'` and then find the position of the first occurrence of `'fun'` in the modified string.

### 34) String Case Formatting
Given a string phrase = "PyTHoN iS AwEsOmE", convert the string so that the first letter is `uppercase` and the rest of the characters are `lowercase`. What is the resulting string?

### 35) Parsing and Formatting Key-Value Data
You have a string data = `"name:John Doe;age:30;profession:Software Engineer"`. Split this string into individual components based on the semicolon `(;)` and then create a list where each element is a key-value pair (as a string) derived from the components. Finally, join these key-value pairs using a comma and a space. What is the final string?

### 36) Substring Occurrence Counting
Given a multiline string paragraph = `"""Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace."""`, count how many times the substring 'Python' (case-sensitive) appears in paragraph.

### 37) Palindrome Checker
Ask the user to input a word, and write a Python program to check if the word is a palindrome. `A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "racecar"`. Ignore case sensitivity and spaces.

### 38) Email Domain Extractor
Write a Python program that asks the user for their email address and then extracts and prints the domain of the email address. For example, if the input is `"user@example.com"`, the output should be `"example.com"`.

### 39) Vowel Count in a String
Ask the user to input a string and write a Python program to count how many vowels `(a, e, i, o, u)` are in the string. Use string methods and consider both uppercase and lowercase vowels. For example, if the input is `"Hello World"`, the output should be `3`.

### 40) Sentence Reversal Magic
Write a Python program that takes a sentence from the user and reverses the order of the words in the sentence. Use string methods to accomplish this. For example, if the input is `"Python is easy to learn"`, the output should be `"learn to easy is Python".`

### 41) Number Reversal Challenge
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then reverses that number using a while loop. For example, if the user enters ``12345`, the program should print `54321`.

### 42) The Classic Number Guessing Game
Implement a "Guess the Number" game in Python where the target number is set to a fixed value within the program `(for example, 42)`. The user has to guess this fixed number. The program should provide hints like `"Too high"` or `"Too low"` based on the user's guesses. Use a while loop to keep the game going until the correct guess is made. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number, and the program should congratulate the user.

### 43) Secure Login System Simulation
Write a Python program that simulates a login system where the user has up to 3 attempts to enter the correct password. The program should ask for input each time and print `"Access granted"` if the correct password is entered, or `"Access denied. Attempts exceeded"` if the user fails all attempts. Assume the correct password is a fixed string in your program.

### 44) Digit Counter Deluxe
Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and uses a while loop to count how many digits the number has. For instance, if the user inputs `75869`, the program should print that the number has `5` digits.

### 45) Guess the Number with a Twist
Modify the classic "Guess the Number" (Problem 42) game by setting a limit on how close the guess must be to the actual number. The program picks a fixed number (say, 50), and the user has unlimited guesses, but they must guess the number exactly or within a range of +/- 5. The program should give feedback `("Too high", "Too low", or "Close enough")` until the user guesses correctly or within the allowed range.
