# 4) Given two variables a = 10 and b = 5, perform the following operations:
# Addition of a and b and store it in a
# Subtraction of b from a store it in b
# Multiplication of a and b and store it in a
# Division of a by b and store it in b
# Exponentiation (a to the power of b)

# Given variables
a = 10
b = 5
# Addition of a and b and store it in a
a = a + b
# Subtraction of b from a and store it in b
b = a - b
# Multiplication of a and b and store it in a
a = a * b
# Division of a by b and store it in b
b = a / b
# Exponentiation (a to the power of b) and store it in a
a = a ** b

# Print the updated values of a and b
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
